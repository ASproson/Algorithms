# Graph Algorithms

Begin with Depth-First Search (DFS): Learn how to traverse graphs and understand applications like cycle detection.
Move to Breadth-First Search (BFS): Learn how to traverse graphs level by level using a queue.
Proceed to Dijkstra's Algorithm: Understand how to find the shortest path in a weighted graph.
Learn Kruskal's and Prim's Algorithms: Understand how to find the minimum spanning tree in a weighted graph.
